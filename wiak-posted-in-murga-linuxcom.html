    <p><span class="postbody">In case you haven't already noticed it buried deep
        in the Applications-&gt;Documents section of the forum, makepup now has
        a fork in the same program-style family called "makeblog". <br>
        <br>
        Makeblog has nothing to do with woof-CE though, being not for woof-CE
        scripts but rather a frontend for bashblog (a single bash script for
        creating local or on-the-web blog sites - all stored in single,
        easy-to-copy directory). Makeblog also provides some enhancements to
        bashblog and, hopefully like makepup, is simple to use (just run it and
        press the Do it! button in the gui). You can find makeblog here: <br>

          <td class="quote">Tip: makeblog is also useful as a note-keeping
            system whether you published the resulting blog pages online or not.
            Can also help organise your local documents since you can include
            links in any blog post to where any document (or photo or video or
            folder) is stored. It is also easy to embed say a youtube video in a
            blog post. I'll post about how to do that later. You can of course
            easily also insert images (including animated gifs) in your blog
            post notes.</td>

      I'm actually using this instead of hierarchical notetaker cherrytree, as
      well as making online github.io blogs with it. Cherrytree was unable to
      use jpeg image files (everything went to png) and the single cherrytree
      notes files became larger than suited me. Also rtf isn't as good as html
      (via bluegriffon or similar wysiwyg html editor) for embedding videos and
      so on. In fact html is a very powerful method for making and storing docs
      and making links to existing ones, all of which I use
      makeblog/enhanced-bashblog for. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE how well cut and paste directly from
        forum post into makeblog new post works</span> (depends on CSS of
      course, but matches forum style wonderfully - try doing that with
      cherrytree or notecase and compare result...). <br>
      <br>
      I have also created a blog post that contains links to folders (trivial to
      do with bluegriffon as makeblog html editor) and various important files
      on my system (including folder with music/videos in it, which I can then
      click to play in background whilst I'm browsing...) so I can easily access
      these resources immediately from within my browser and also browse my blog
      notes. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">TIP: Make a personal local blog index page
        the homepage for your browser - and use that local blog ito manage all
        your notes and contents.</span> <br>
      <br>
      Makeblog doesn't (yet, or ever?) contain any local search for text in post
      utility, but for now at least I use geany for searching for text strings
      in my makeblog-generated blog notes - geany has a truly excellent Search
      -&gt; Find in Files utility that even allows use of regular expressions,
      so you can quickly find name of note the text is in and then open it in
      browser etc. Just point geany FInd in FIles to current local makeblog
      directory and enter search term and the result will pop up. Or simply use
      grep (or even sed!) from the makeblog folder: <br>

          <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="code">grep -rn '&lt;text_string_to_search_for&gt;' *.html</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <span class="postbody"> <br>
      with some extra coding could no doubt get grep search result, as part of a
      gui, in a clickable window to open up in browser or html code editor (but
      I haven't written that code). <br>
      <br>
      Tested on both Slacko64 and XenialDog32. But should work on pretty much
      any Puppy. <br>
